# Chat App

This trivial chat app uses an addressable DWN (other approaches will soon be available that are p2p and don't require a publicly addressable DWN).

## Building and Running Chat app

* Make sure you have run the pre-requisite steps in the [README](../README.md)
* Build and run the addressable DWN in a separate termional window: instructions [here](../addressable-dwn/README.md)
* use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to open a public port to your local DWN by running `ngrok http 3000` - take note of the public https URL that it returns. You'll need this later.
* Build and run the chat-app in another terminal window: `cd chat-app && npm install && npm run dev`
* Click on the wallet action in the sidebar and create a Profile. For DWN Host Provider, put the address of the addressable dwn you just started with the public https url from ngrok above.
* Pop open a browser and head to `http://localhost:5275`
* In the DWN Request Access Popup, select the Profile you just created.
* find someone to send a message to and talk to them, you can find your DID in the wallet sidebar sidebar and use the "copy" icon to share it.

## Interesting code

Take a look at [src/App.vue](./src/App.vue) to see how the app is built, take note of the "protocol" being installed for chat.
