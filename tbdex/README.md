## how to start this project

in one bash window, run `node bundle.js && npx http-server .`, then navigate to localhost:8080/alice.html

do the same in a new bash window, then navigate to localhost:8081:pfi.html

you should now have 2 separate DIDs (one belonging to Alice, another to PFI) so they can start pushing / pulling data.
